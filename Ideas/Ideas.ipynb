If $i + j + k = 1$, the GTO possesses axial symmetry along one axis and is considered a $p$-type GTO. When $i + j + k = 2$, there are six possible GTOs that may be constructed; this is one more than the five canonical $d$ orbital functions for a given angular quantum number. To address this, a linear combination of two $d$-type GTOs can be used to reproduce a canonical $d$ function. "
