Most of them are based on expansion over single particle functions. These single particle functions are eigenfunctions of some one-electron operator where the explicit coupling (or correlation) between the particles (here electrons) is neglected. The most common approach is the Hartree-Fock method were the interaction between the electrons is approximated as a mean field. An Hartree-Fock calculation produces a set of single-particle function $\\phi_i$ (also called molecular orbitals: MOs) that are expressed as linear combination of basis functions $\\chi_{j}$ which are referred to as atomic orbitals (AOs):\n","\n","$$ \\phi_i = \\sum^{N_{basis}}_{j} c_{ij}\\chi_{j}$$\n","\n","$N_{basis}$ is the size of the AO basis and $c_{ij}$ are the optimized coefficients, usually called molecular orbital coefficients.\n","The MOs are separated into occupied orbitals, characterized by negative energy, and unoccupied orbitals (positive energy). They are eigenfunctions of the Fock operator (see Chapter $8.7-8.8$ of the lecture notes) <br><br>\n","\n","#### **Treatment of excited states**\n","\n","An accurate treatment of excited states involves expansion of the wave function unto basis of deterinant (cf. CI method: Chapter $8.2$ in the lecture notes) or time-dependent approaches. Here we will deal with excited states using a much simpler (and faster) method. \n","In the Hartree-Fock (HF) method, an approximation of excitation energy can be obtain by taking the sum of the absolute value of the two MOs energy involved in the transition. This is usually referred to as Koopman's theorem. \n","\n","For example the first valence excited states of a molecule is usually characterize by a single excitation from the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) to the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital).\n","In the CO molecule, within a define basis set, the LUMO has an energy of $0.154$ au and the HOMO has an energy of $-0.545$ au. The excitation energy associated to this HOMO --> LUMO transition is therefore $abs(-0.545)+abs(0.154)=0.699$ au\n","\n","One should be aware that this crude approximation neglects many effects: electron correlation and orbital relaxation among others. Even a quantitative excitation energy is rarely obtained. For example, the relaxation correction to this model can be quite big with around 15eV for C, 1 eV for N and 0.2 eV for Oxygen (Stohr J., NEXAFS Spectroscopy, Springer, 1996, pp 22). However, considering the demonstrative purposes of this exercise, the HF model will be enough. <br><br>\n","\n","#### **K-edge spectrum**\n","\n","K-edge spectrum refers to a spectrum obtained when a X-Ray light excites a $1s$ inner core orbital. The resulting excited state may lay below the ionization potential (IP) of the $1s$ orbital, leading to pre-edge and edge spectral lines, or above the IP, leading to above-edge structure. In the one-electron picture, these spectral features arise due to transitions from the 1s core orbital to valence excited MOs.\n","\n","In the present exercise you will calculate the excitation energies and transition dipole moment of core-to-valence transition for various molecules. The idea is to understand which properties, unique to each molecule, can be retrieved by means of X-ray spectroscopy. <br><br>\n","\n","#### **Spectral line intensity**\n","\n","The height of a spectral line is proportional to the transition moment between the two states involved in the transition. Different quantities are used to characterize the intensity of a transition. The oscillator strength can be define as:\n","\n","$$f_{ik}=\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\Delta E}{g_i} \\sum_{\\alpha}|<\\Psi_k|\\hat{d}_{\\alpha}|\\Psi_i>|^2$$\n","\n","where $\\Delta E$ is the excitation energy from the initial state $i$ to the final state $k$, $g_i$ is the degeneracy of the initial state and $\\hat{d}_{\\alpha}$ is $\\alpha$ component of the dipole operator. <br><br>\n","\n","#### **Chemical bond**\n","\n","The chemical bond is the force that held atoms together to form molecules. The strength of a chemical bond $A-B$ can be define by the energy needed to seperate both fragment $A$ and $B$. In many case, the MOs involving valence electrons, hold information on the bonding character (strong, weak , etc) of the molecule.\n","\n","As an example, the carbon atom can bond to an other carbon via different types of chemical bond: single, double and triple bond. Information of the type of chemical bond can be obtained from the valence MOs (the HOMO and LUMO).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K-qdpK3ExQEU"},"source":["### **Calculating a K-edge spectra: example with the CO molecule**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XrFeNN9Upr05"},"source":["#### **Step 1: Hartree Fock calculation and analysis of the MOs**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7fJ7kdQdxQEV"},"source":["First we create an python object that we call \"CO\".

The first case arises from the intrinsic finite life-time (coupling with the field or other states) and the second is due to collision-induced decay (in a gas for example). One can define a phenomenological decay probability $\\Gamma$, which is related to the life-time $\\tau$ by $\\Gamma=1/\\tau$, that account for all possible decay channel.
